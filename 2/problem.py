Assignment 2

Python version 3.9 or later.

Overview:
    This file implements the assignment challenge along with a test harness.
    You do NOT need to modify this file; instead, add your solutions to 'solution.py'.

Required Packages:
    - pycryptodome: Install by running `pip install pycryptodome`.
    The documentation is available at https://www.pycryptodome.org/.
    You only need this package to run the script; it is not required for implementing your solutions.

Usage:
    To verify your solutions, run: `python problem.py`.
    (Make sure that both `solution.py` and `problem.py` are in the same directory.)
